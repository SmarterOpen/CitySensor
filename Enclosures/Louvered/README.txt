# Summary

Open Source Air Quality Sensor housing project being built for use in Birmingham.  Uses a Raspberry Pi W Zero and a Trinket plus a custom "Hat" to connect all of the sensors.  Room in the base for batteries and other necessities as well as mounting holes to tie it to a bracket.  Uses about .313Kg of plastic to print one set of all pieces.

Suggest painting with white paint any surface that would be subject to sunlight to prevent plastic degradation.  Doing testing with ESUN white PETG filament.
2 new louvers published to use with Honeywell HPMA115S0 Dust Particulate Laser interferometer

Control system and hardware still being developed.
Two versions of sensors have been built using this.  Githubs for this is located at
https://github.com/dnear1/LoPy4-ABP-htu21d-mpl3115a2-tsl2561-hpma115s0

Notes: 
Use 8-32 threaded rod (3 pieces about 5.75" long) plus wing nuts to hold the stack together.  To mount the rods in the base, gently clamp them in a drill and use that to thread it in slowly until the bottom of the rod is flush with the bottom of the enclosure.  There should be sufficient clamping force to keep them from backing out. Otherwise, use any epoxy or plastic-safe glue in the threads before driving them into the mount holes.
